# Olfactory Coding and Decision Making

Organisms navigate their surroundings using information inferred from the spatially and temporally complex odor plume. I am interested in understanding the principle behind the neural processing of how a brain encodes, perceives, and makes decisions accordingly.

# Dynamics of Signal Transduction through Sensory Receptors

The olfactory signals are generated through a complex ligand-receptor binding process between odorants and olfactory receptors. I build models and use simulation studies to explain and characterize the dynamics of chemosensory signals.

# Structure-function Relationship in Neural Processing

The spatial distribution and structures of neurons are diverse. These physical properties shape the complex neural dynamics observed in the brain which are poorly understood. I study the structure-function relationship in neural processing using large-scale data analysis that utilizes the latest connectomics and reconstruction datasets. Integrating the concepts from information theory, I use compartmental neuron models to understand the effect of structural properties on the function of single neurons and small neural circuits.

# Software and Algorithm Development for Biology

Biological processes are complex, requiring advanced software tools and algorithms to understand. I develop tools to analyze biological networks such as biochemical reactions, neural networks, and signaling networks. I am also interested in high-throughput optimization algorithms, network inference techniques, and novel clustering algorithms for biological systems. I work to improve model reuse and reproducibility in biological models.
