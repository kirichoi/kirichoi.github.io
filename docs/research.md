# Dynamics of Chemosensory Receptors

During odor-guided navigation, animals must interpret context-dependent information from fluctuating odor signals to make informed decisions. To understand how olfactory neurons encode this sensory information, I investigate the dynamics of ligand-receptor binding between odorants and olfactory receptors.

# Olfactory Coding and Decision Making

In addition to olfactory cues, navigational decision-making is shaped by the odor value, which is closely linked to its function and context. I am interested in understanding the principles behind how the brain encodes odors, how odor perception evolves, and how various navigational cues are integrated to guide informed decision-making.

# Structure to Function in Neural Processing

The brain's structural, spatial, and connective features govern neural dynamics. I investigate the relationship between neuron structure and function by analyzing and creating models based on large-scale connectomics and structural reconstruction data.

# Softwares/Algorithms for Biological Systems

Biological processes are complex and demand advanced software tools and algorithms. I develop tools to analyze biological networks, including biochemical reactions, neural networks, and signaling pathways. My research also focuses on high-throughput optimization algorithms, network inference techniques, and innovative clustering methods for biological systems. Additionally, I work to enhance model reuse and reproducibility in biological modeling.
