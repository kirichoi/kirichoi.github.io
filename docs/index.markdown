    <p class="padding">I am interested in how the brain encodes and processes olfactory information to make decisions. 
I apply computational neuroscience and systems biology to understand the signal processing in the insect olfactory system, particularly that of common fruit flies (<em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>).
I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Emonet Lab at Yale University supported by the Swartz Foundation Fellowship, studying olfactory receptors and odor-guided navigation.
Previously, I worked as a research fellow at the Korea Institute for Advanced Study under the mentorship of Professor Changbong Hyeon, where I studied the relationship between the spatial and structural characteristics of neurons and their functionality.
I was PhD at the University of Washington under the advice of Professor Herbert Sauro, where I studied the biochemical reaction networks using high-throughput simulation studies.
