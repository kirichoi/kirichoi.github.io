  I am interested in how the brain encodes and processes olfactory information and makes appropriate decisions. 
  I apply computational neuroscience and systems biology to understand the signal processing in the insect olfactory system, particularly that of common fruit flies.
  I am a postdoctoral fellow at Emonet Lab at Yale University, supported by the Swartz Foundation Fellowship, studying olfactory receptors and odor-guided navigation.

  Previously, I was a research fellow at the Korea Institute for Advanced Study under the mentorship of Professor Changbong Hyeon, where I studied how the physical characteristics of neurons translate to their functionality and the perceptive space of the olfactory system.
  I completed my PhD in Bioengineering at the University of Washington under the advice of Professor Herbert Sauro, where I designed the biochemical reaction networks using high-throughput simulation studies.
