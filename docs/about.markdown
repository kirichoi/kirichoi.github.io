  I am interested in understanding how the brain encodes and processes olfactory information to make appropriate decisions. 
  Using computational and behavioral neuroscience approaches, I investigate information processing in insect olfactory systems, with a focus on <em>Drosophila</em>. 
  I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Emonet Lab at Yale University, supported by the Swartz Foundation Fellowship, where I study olfactory receptors and odor-guided navigation.

  Previously, as a research fellow at the Korea Institute for Advanced Study under the mentorship of Professor Changbong Hyeon, I explored how the brain's structural, spatial, and connective features relate to its functionality, with a particular interest in how the olfactory system robustly encodes odor identity. 
  I received my PhD in Bioengineering at the University of Washington under the mentorship of Professor Herbert Sauro, where I studied complex biochemical reaction networks.
